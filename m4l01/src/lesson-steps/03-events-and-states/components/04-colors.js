/* Exercise
for both Func and Class components:

1. Add a Click event handler to the colored boxes so a click in a box is registered by printed out to the console

2. Add state so the total number of clicks is kept as a state in the component.
   - the total should presented in browser as part of the <h1> header tag
   Hint: you can use a state clickCount and initialize the state it as:
   		func comp - const [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState (0);
		class comp - this.state = {clickCount: 0};  

3. Make a new Component Latin that consists of a <p> tag and a <button>
